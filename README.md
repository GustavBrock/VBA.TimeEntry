### Entering 24-hour time with input mask and full validation in *Microsoft Access*

Entering time in Microsoft Access can be difficult. An input mask often bothers users more than helping them and won't catch all typing errors.
This form with code-behind shows how to create a textbox for 24-hour time input with full validation politely catching all errors. 

### Code ###
Code has been tested with both 32-bit and 64-bit *Microsoft Access 365*.

### Documentation ###
For code walk-through, further info, and a working demo application, go to the article at Experts-Exchange:
